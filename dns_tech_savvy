# DNS List - Tech Savvy
# This list is one I generally permit outbound, but only for those who are tech savvy / unlikely to fall for scams.
# It contains a list of URL's that I usually like to block for regular users to help prevent them getting scammed.
# However, these blocks would likely be inconvenient for those who are somewhat tech savvy and who use stuff like remote desktop software.
